Aim of the project: 
                    To enable intuitive and hands-free computer interaction by accurately interpreting hand gestures,
					providing users with a seamless and ergonomic alternative to conventional mouse input methods.

Description:
            The gesture control mouse project aims to develop a novel interface for controlling a computer mouse
			using hand gestures instead of traditional physical input devices like a mouse or touchpad. This project
            leverages computer vision and machine learning techniques to interpret hand movements captured by a camera
			in real-time, translating them into corresponding actions on the computer screen. By tracking hand gestures 
            accurately and efficiently, users can navigate, click, drag, and perform other mouse functions seamlessly 
            without physical contact with a traditional mouse or touchpad.
